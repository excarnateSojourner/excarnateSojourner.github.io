	<p>Have you ever discovered that a word you thought you knew actually means something different? These are mine, and a few others I've heard of.</p>
	<p>All actual pronunciations and definitions below are from the English Wiktionary, an online dictionary. They are licensed under the <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/' target='_blank'>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a>. This information was created cooperatively by thousands of editors (<a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:ListUsers?editsOnly=1&creationSort=1&limit=50' target='_blank'>complete list</a>). I have adapted the pronunciations to use <a href='https://youtu.be/gtnlGH055TA' target='_blank'>more accurate transcriptions of glides</a>. I also used Wiktionary to find quotes from other sources.</p>
