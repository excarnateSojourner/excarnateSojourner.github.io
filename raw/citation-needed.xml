	<p>Users of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikpedia</a> who come across an unsupported claim that should be supported by a citation are encouraged to add the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>citation needed template</a> after the claim, which renders like this: <sup>[<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed'><i>citation needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
	<p><a href='https://what-if.xkcd.com/'><i>What If</i></a> is a webcomic written by Randall Monroe (who also writes <a href='https://xkcd.com/'><i>xkcd</i></a>) in which he gives scientific answers to absurd "what if...?" questions. He has made a running gag in <i>What If</i> of adding "<sup>[<a href='#'><i>citation needed</i></a>]</sup>" after he makes a statement that is obviously true (<a href='https://what-if.xkcd.com/92/'>example</a>).</p>
