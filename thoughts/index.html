			<h1>Thoughts</h1>
			<p>These are short thoughts of mine, mostly copied from social media posts that I have made.</p>
			<h2>2014</h2>
				<!-- h3 has purposefully been skipped because these sections are usually small (and therefore look weird with large headings). -->
				<h4>12-14</h4>
					<p>Most people live in Asia. (Sources: Compare <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia'>Asia&rsquo;s population</a> to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population'>world population</a>.)</p>
			<h2>2015</h2>
				<h4>01-02</h4>
					<p>6 of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue'>7 largest companies in the world (by revenue)</a> are oil and gas companies.</p>
					<p><i>Update 2020: This has since changed slightly.</i></p>
				<h4>04-23</h4>
					<p>You are never going to have more time than you do right now.</p>
				<h4>05-02</h4>
					<p>The concept of a music genre sounds good in theory, but in practice, not every song fits neatly into a genre, and many genres seem to overlap. Music is like a room, and a song is like a point in the room. Music genres try to take that point and fit it into one of the 10 or so small boxes that humans have arbitrarily put in different places in the room.</p>
				<h4>06-17</h4>
					<p>When you say you do not have time to do something, you are not only saying that it is not a priority for you; you are saying it should not be.</p>
				<h4>06-18</h4>
					<p>Can you think of anything that could exist on the web that doesn&rsquo;t? Because I&rsquo;m finding it difficult to.</p>
				<h4>06-22</h4>
					<p>&ldquo;His love is an incomprehensibly vast, bottomless, shoreless sea before which we kneel in joyful silence and from which the loftiest eloquence retreats confused and abashed.&rdquo; - A. W. Tozer, <i>The Knowledge of the Holy</i>.<p>
				<h4>08-24</h4>
					<p>When you are bored or doing something that you dislike, please do not express your feelings by making a gun with your hand and pretending to shoot yourself in the head. Suicide is serious, and your boredom is such a first world problem. Thank you.</p>
				<h4>09-25</h4>
					<p>India has a larger total land area than Greenland. (Sources: Compare <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India'>India</a> to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland'>Greenland</a>.)</p>
				<h4>12-11</h4>
					<p>&ldquo;Some of you will die in the service of Christ. This will not be a tragedy. Treasuring life above Christ is a tragedy.&rdquo; - John Piper, <i><a href='https://www.desiringgod.org/books/dont-waste-your-life'>Don&rsquo;t Waste Your Life</a></i>, Preface.</p>
			<h2>2016</h2>
				<h4>04-15</h4>
					<p>Sometimes I wonder how anyone can live a single day without having a relationship with God. Then I remember that (in a way) they don&rsquo;t.</p>
				<h4>10-23</h4>
					<p>&ldquo;Which is harder: to make a fortune, or to give it all away?&rdquo; - John Piper, &ldquo;<a href='https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/i-have-kept-the-faith'>I Have Kept the Faith</a>&rdquo;.</p>
			<h2>2017</h2>
				<h4>10-18</h4>
					<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t live in a world where we have to choose between seeking our happiness and seeking God&rsquo;s glory or doing right. They go together.&rdquo; - John Piper, &ldquo;<a href='https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/get-wisdom'>Get Wisdom</a>&rdquo;.</p>
			<h2>2018</h2>
				<h4>03-25</h4>
					<p>Ever wondered what God thinks of the way some people say &ldquo;just joking&rdquo; or &ldquo;just kidding&rdquo;? Proverbs 26:18â€“19 (ESV): &ldquo;Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, &lsquo;I am only joking!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
				<h4>05-05</h4>
					<img src='1-3-8in.jpg'>
					<p>Does this mean:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>1 in + 3/8 in,</li>
						<li>between 1 in and 3/8 in,</li>
						<li>between 1/8 in and 3/8 in,</li>
						<li>(1 - 3)/8 in,</li>
						<li>or 1 in - 3/8 in?</li>
					</ol>
					<p>This is why we can&rsquo;t have nice things, America. :P</p>
				<h4>10-23</h4>
					<p>Apparently Chegg won&rsquo;t even let you see their full ads without a subscription. :P</p>

				<h4>12-01</h4>
				<p>How is it that North Korea is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations'>a member of the United Nations</a>, <em>and</em> it is listed alphabetically under <i>D</i>, because the first word in its official name is <i>democratic</i>?</p>
				<p>Reading through the 30 articles in the <a href='https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights'>UN&rsquo;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, it is my understanding that North Korea is breaking at least 24 of them.</p>
			<h2>2019</h2>
				<h4>09-02</h4>
					<p>If Adam told his descendants about Eden, those stories would have been older at the time of the flood than our records of the fall of the Roman Empire are today. (Sources: Summing the ages of fathers when their sons were born in Noah&rsquo;s genealogy and Noah&rsquo;s age at the time of the flood <a href='https://answersingenesis.org/bible-timeline/timeline-for-the-flood/'>gives a span of 1,656 years</a>. The decline of the Western Roman Empire happened gradually over centuries, but the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire'>traditional date of its fall is 476</a>. 2019 - 476 = 1,543 years.)</p>
			<h2>2021</h2>
				<h4>09-18</h4>
					<p>&ldquo;The cost of perfection is infinite.&rdquo; - CGP Grey, <a href='http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/1'>Hello Internet episode 1</a>, 27:02.</p>
			<h2>Date unknown</h2>
				<p>Jesus does not have half-hearted disciples. He didn&rsquo;t then; he doesn&rsquo;t now.</p>
				<p>Praying is breaking the fourth wall of real life.</p>
				<p>One of the hardest things for an introvert to communicate effectively is passion.</p>
				<p>Seeing heaven for the first time might be similar to the experiences of people who have been colour blind for their whole life and receive glasses that let them see colours that they have never seen before. Or perhaps it is more like taking off glasses that have caused us to see the world in black and white our whole lives.</p>
				<p>A technologically savvy person who tries to lead a technologically ignorant person through a technological process without being able to see what they are doing is like a blind man who tries to teach a deaf man how to paint without touching him.</p>
				<p>Life is war.</p>
				<p>If one wants to create their own meaning and set of emotions for a song written by someone else, making it fit their experiences, dreams, etc., and never have this association wrecked or shown to be arbitrary, strange, or wrong, it is much safer to listen to unpopular artists.</p>
				<p>The Gospel could not possibly be more important or more urgent.</p>
