			<h1>Abortion</h1>
			<p>If unborn people are still people nonetheless, then about half of all deaths are abortions.</p>
			<p>The World Health Organization reports that there were “<a href='https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death'>56.9 million deaths worldwide in 2016</a>”, and “<a href='https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/preventing-unsafe-abortion'>between 2010 – 2014, on average, 56 million … abortions occurred worldwide each year</a>”.</p>
			<p>This means that this video, which was created to show the global death rate, also roughly shows the global abortion rate.</p>

			<p>That's 1.77 people per second. This is a holocaust. More precisely, it is more than <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust'>five holocausts</a> every year.</p>
			<p>Some think that unborn people are not people. But how can we be sure? What if they are people? Is there not at least some ambiguity here? Are we not obligated to be as careful as possible when individual lives are at stake, nevermind millions?</p>
			<p>If unborn people are people, <a href='https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/preventing-unsafe-abortion'>a quarter of people</a> are murdered before they get any chance to love, laugh, play, sing, dance, give, vote, or become a hero. A quarter of would-be songwriters, painters, astronaughts, doctors, scientists, engineers, teachers, husbands, wives, dads, moms, and grandparents are killed before they take their first breath.</p>
			<p>Abortion is not caused by some seemingly uncontrollable and random force like cancer. (The numbers above exclude uninduced miscarriages and stillbirths.) Every abortion is chosen and performed by people. Many feel they have no other option. But we can change this.</p>
			<p>I am a man, but this is just as much a human rights issue as it is a women's rights issue.</p>
			<p>If unborn people are people, can you name a bigger injustice in the world than this?</p>
