			<h1>Wiktionary</h1>
			
	<p><a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page'>Wiktionary</a> is a free, online dictionary that nearly anyone can contribute to.</p>
	<h2>Quotes</h2>
	<blockquote>how does the first cousin marriage work? are there risks involved with the kids if cousins marry. For example marrying mother's sister's daughter?</blockquote>

	<blockquote>We don't need a new namespace, Dave. <b>WF</b> can only mean one thing here.</blockquote>
	<p><a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Genecioso'>Genecioso</a> in 2018 on <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Permalink/49660435#Category:Wiktionary:Foo_â†’_Category:Wiktionary_foo'>Requests for moves, mergers and splits</a>.

	<h2>Collective nouns</h2>
	<p>A collective noun is a term for a collection of a particular type of thing, like <i>pride</i> in "a pride of lions".
	<p>Wiktionary had three different lists of collective nouns, so I <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:ExcarnateSojourner/Collective nouns'>combined them</a>. But the lists included many terms that were very unlikely to actually be used outside of trivia, and would still be very esoteric even if they were. These are a few of the least believable ones I found.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>a tabernacle of bakers</p></li>
		<li><p>a holiness of donuts</p></li>
		<li><p>A swirl of paisleys</p></li>
		<li><p>A <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/malapertness'>malapertness</a> of peddlers</p></li>
	</ul>
