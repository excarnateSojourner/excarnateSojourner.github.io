			<h1>Wiktionary</h1>
			
	<p><a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page' target='_blank'>Wiktionary</a> is a free, online dictionary that nearly anyone can contribute to. I have a <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:ExcarnateSojourer' target='_blank'>user page</a> there because I edit Wiktionary, but saving random, funny things you find on your user page is not quite within the <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Usernames_and_user_pages#User_pages' target='_blank'>guidelines</a>, so I save them here instead.</p>
	<h2>Quotes</h2>

	<p>&mdash;An anonymous user (12.47.208.50) in 2006 on the <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Permalink/926856' target='_blank'>discussion page for <i>first cousin</i></a>. The user may have been suggesting the entry should contain this information (rather than asking because they actually wanted to know the answer), but even then it would be encyclopedic information which <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:What Wiktionary is not' target='_blank'>Wiktionary is not meant to contain</a>.</p>
	<blockquote>We don't need a new namespace, Dave. <b>WF</b> can only mean one thing here.</blockquote>

"<b>WF</b>" refers to <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:WF' target='_blank'>Wonderfool</a>, a notorious editor.</p>
	<blockquote>It begs the question: How much wood would a woodswallow swallow if a woodswallow swallowed wood?</blockquote>
	<p>&mdash; <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Notusbutthem' target='_blank'>Notusbutthem</a> (believed to be Wonderfool) in 2022 on the <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:woodswallow' target='_blank'>discussion page for <i>woodswallow</i></a>.</p>
	<blockquote>Boston Mess became named Boston Mess when an anonymous juggler who had practiced the trick (he called it skyscrapers) demonstrated it in Harvard Yard on July 5, 1988, and said that it was called Boston Mess. I know this because it was me.</blockquote>

	<h2>Collective nouns</h2>
	<p>A collective noun is a term for a collection of a particular type of thing, like <i>pride</i> in "a pride of lions".
	<p>Wiktionary had three different lists of collective nouns, so I <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:ExcarnateSojourner/Collective nouns' target='_blank'>combined them</a>. But the lists included many terms that were very unlikely to actually be used outside of trivia, and would still be very esoteric even if they were. These are a few of the least believable ones I found.</p>
