			<h1>Wiktionary</h1>
			
	<p><a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page'>Wiktionary</a> is a free, online dictionary that nearly anyone can contribute to. I have a <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:ExcarnateSojourer'>user page</a> there because I edit Wiktionary, but saving random, funny things you find on your user page is not quite within the <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Usernames_and_user_pages#User_pages'>guidelines</a>, so I save them here instead.</p>
	<h2>Quotes</h2>
	<blockquote>how does the first cousin marriage work? are there risks involved with the kids if cousins marry. For example marrying mother's sister's daughter?</blockquote>
	<p>&mdash;An anonymous user (12.47.208.50) in 2006 on the discussion page for <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Permalink/926856'><i>first cousin</i></a>. The user may have been suggesting the entry should contain this information (rather than asking because they actually wanted to know the answer), but even then it would be encyclopedic information which <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:What Wiktionary is not'>Wiktionary is not meant to contain</a>.</p>
	<blockquote>We don't need a new namespace, Dave. <b>WF</b> can only mean one thing here.</blockquote>
	<p>&mdash;<a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Genecioso'>Genecioso</a> in 2018 on <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Permalink/49660435#Category:Wiktionary:Foo_â†’_Category:Wiktionary_foo'>Requests for moves, mergers and splits</a>. "<b>WF</b>" refers to <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:WF'>Wonderfool</a>, a notorious editor.</p>

	<h2>Collective nouns</h2>
	<p>A collective noun is a term for a collection of a particular type of thing, like <i>pride</i> in "a pride of lions".
	<p>Wiktionary had three different lists of collective nouns, so I <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:ExcarnateSojourner/Collective nouns'>combined them</a>. But the lists included many terms that were very unlikely to actually be used outside of trivia, and would still be very esoteric even if they were. These are a few of the least believable ones I found.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>a tabernacle of bakers</p></li>
		<li><p>a holiness of donuts</p></li>
		<li><p>A swirl of paisleys</p></li>
		<li><p>A <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/malapertness'>malapertness</a> of peddlers</p></li>
	</ul>
